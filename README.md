## Description

This was a project that I created which is part of the course <a href="https://www.udemy.com/courses/search/?src=ukw&q=The+Complete+Python+Course+%7C+Learn+Python+by+Doing" target="_blank">The Complete Python Course | Learn Python by Doing.</a>
The program is a console application. The user can add and delete entries for movies, in addition to searching for those entries based on specified parameters. I used different ways to implement the functionality than the instructor did in several parts of the project.
