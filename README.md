This was a project that I created which is part of the course "The Complete Python Course | Learn Python by Doing(https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-python-course/learn/v4/overview).
The program is a console application. The user can add and delete entries for movies, in addition to searching for those entries based on specified parameters.
